This package ("webDescription_Leon") is used to represent a webpage

All concrete classes fo this package must be declared in server/app/programEvaluator/WebDescriptionClassesRegister

There is a chance that the classes from WebDescription may not be serialisable by default by boopickle)the serialisation library)
Especially when there is recursive typing (ex: a case class whose argument is a list of elements of its class).
If boopickle throws an error when attempting to serialise, the solution is to tell boopickle about the hierarchy so that he can serialise properly.
This can be done in shared/src/main/scala/shared/Picklers (see the pickler for WebElement).
Also, for unknown reasons, recursive typing will always fail when a class has a "List" of object of the same class as argument. Please use a "Seq" instead.
